Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a [static site generator](https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/). Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your websiteâ€™s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast and secure. Hugo sites can be hosted anywhere, including [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/), [Surge](https://surge.sh/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files), [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website), and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) and work well with CDNs. Hugo sites run without the need for a database or dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python, or PHP.

We think of Hugo as the ideal website creation tool with nearly instant build times, able to rebuild whenever a change is made.
